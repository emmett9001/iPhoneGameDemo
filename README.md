Working with Git
================

Cloning
-------
The first thing you'll need to do is copy this repository to your computer.
Using Mac Terminal (Applications/Utilities/Terminal), `cd` into a directory
where you'll keep your XCode projects, like

    mkdir git
    cd git

Then, `clone` the repository to copy it onto your system.

    git clone https://github.com/emmett9001/iPhoneGameDemo.git

Once you've cloned, you can open `iPhoneGameDemo.xcodeproj` in XCode and run
the project.

Checking out commits
--------------------
This project is set up so at any time, you can skip forward and back in the
change history to see different stages of the development. This is especially
helpful in a group setting where you don't want to fall behind. Git provides
a command `checkout` to allow users to jump to any commit.
